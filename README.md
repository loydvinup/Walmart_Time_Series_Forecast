Walmart Sales Forecasting

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Walmart's weekly sales data to identify key trends and forecast future sales using time series forecasting and machine learning models. The dataset contains sales information from multiple Walmart outlets along with economic indicators such as unemployment rate, consumer price index (CPI), fuel prices, temperature, and holiday markers.

Objectives

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify relationships between sales and economic factors.

Detect seasonal sales trends and their causes.

Examine the impact of unemployment, temperature, and CPI on sales.

Rank stores based on their performance.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values and outliers.

Perform feature engineering.

Normalize and encode categorical variables.

Sales Forecasting

Build predictive models to forecast sales for the next 12 weeks.

Compare different machine learning models.

Dataset Information

Total Rows: 6435

Columns: Store, Date, Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag, Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment

Data Source: Walmart historical sales records

Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values in CPI and Unemployment.

Merged different datasets (stores, features, and sales data).

Converted date values to datetime format and extracted year, month, and week.

Detected and removed outliers using Z-score.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Monthly and weekly sales trends visualization.

Correlation analysis between sales and external factors.

Impact analysis of holidays on sales.

3. Machine Learning Models for Forecasting

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Deep Neural Network (DNN)

4. Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using metrics like:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared score (R²)

Model accuracy comparison through visualization.

Results & Insights

Sales show clear seasonal trends, with peaks during holiday seasons.

Unemployment and CPI significantly impact sales in certain stores.

XGBoost and Random Forest performed the best for sales forecasting.

Deep Learning models also performed well but required more training time.

Conclusion

This project successfully explored Walmart's sales trends and built predictive models for future sales. The insights derived can help optimize inventory, improve store performance, and refine business strategies.
